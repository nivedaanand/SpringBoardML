As we know Genrative AI has teaken the world by storm with the rise of CHat GPT, Google Bard. I would like to spend some time understanding the various Generative AI modela, and applying them to a security use case.
As I work for cybe security I am very much inspired to use generative AI  for cybersecurity.
Some of my ideas include --
1. User Behavior Modeling System
2. Email Monitoring System
3. Credit card Fraud Detection

Not sure if Generative AI will be solution for it, might also consider NLP if required.
