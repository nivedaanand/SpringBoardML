I. Introduction

The exponential growth of digital data has led to an information overload, making it challenging to extract relevant information quickly. 
This project aims to develop an automated text summarization system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Text summarization is a method of shortening long pieces of information into a concise summary that retains key points, 
reducing reading time while maintaining the essence of the content. The proposed system will utilize NLP techniques to understand the context and semantics of the text, enabling it to generate accurate and meaningful summaries.

II. Objectives 

The primary objective is to design and implement an NLP-based text summarization system that can generate accurate, concise, and coherent summaries. 
The system will be evaluated based on its ability to retain key information, readability, and relevance of the summaries.

III. Methodology 

The project will employ Extractive and Abstractive summarization techniques. Extractive summarization involves identifying important sections of the text and generating them verbatim. 
On the other hand, Abstractive summarization generates new sentences from the original text.

The project will use Python programming language and NLP libraries like NLTK and SpaCy for text processing. Machine learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Transformer model will be used for training the summarization system.

The system will be trained on a large corpus of text data. The data will be preprocessed, tokenized, and vectorized before feeding it into the model. The model will then be trained to understand the context and semantics of the text.

IV. Expected Results 

The expected outcome is a robust text summarization system that can generate accurate and concise summaries of long text documents. The system should be able to understand the context and semantics of the text, enabling it to generate summaries that retain the key points of the original text.

The system's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score, which measures the quality of the summaries by comparing them with human-written summaries.

V. Conclusion 

The proposed text summarization system will significantly reduce the time and effort required to understand long text documents. It has potential applications in various fields such as news summarization, academic research, legal document summarization, and more. 
The project will contribute to the ongoing research in the field of NLP and text summarization, providing a foundation for future improvements and innovations.
